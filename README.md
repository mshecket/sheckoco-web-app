# sheckoco-web-app
This is a portfolio project! I'm creating a web app that's a pretend investing website,
based loosely off of Fidelity Investments (although hopefully better in some ways!). It
uses React and some components from Material UI. When complete, it will make API calls
to two different servers: one will serve up randomly generated dynamic stock prices of
fake stocks, and one will store and serve up the customer's account information: cash
and stock holdings, orders, and the like.
